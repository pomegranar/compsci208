# Anar's Tree Scene

A simple procedurally generated scene of a tree with clouds moving with parallax.

Seasons can be changed with keys 1-4, and the noise seed can be randomized with the r key.

Clouds move in a parallax motion, creating a 3D effect on a 2D canvas.

A simple tree was added to improve the illusion of depth.

No AI input was involved.
