# A Tree for the Season

A simple procedurally generated scene of a tree with clouds moving with parallax.

Seasons can be changed with keys <kbd>1</kbd><kbd>2</kbd><kbd>3</kbd><kbd>4</kbd>, and the noise seed can be randomized with the <kbd>r</kbd> key.

Clouds move in a parallax motion, creating a 3D effect on a 2D canvas.

A simple tree was added to improve the illusion of depth.

_No AI input was involved._
