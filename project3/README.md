# Project 3: Image Rewritten

Work title: Induced Topography

The assignment was to transform an image algorithmically to reveal the underlying structure.

Running `project3.pde` will reveal an interactive exploration of a 3-dimensional interpretation of an image taken from the latest album by The Marías.

The data used (images) are stored in the data folder, which contains a few pairs of images and their depth map, generated using ![DepthAnythingAC](https://github.com/HVision-NKU/DepthAnythingAC).

The main mode of interaction is through the user's webcam, allowing the user's head position to control the virtual camera to create a parallax effect. Note that this was not working the last time I tested it, so you can also use your mouse cursor to view the scene from different angles.
